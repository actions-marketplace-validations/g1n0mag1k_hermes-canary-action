# hermes-canary-action

Zero-PHI-egress synthetic PHI canary tests and tamper-evident compliance receipts for healthtech CI/CD pipelines. Drop this composite GitHub Action into your workflow to verify that error monitoring scrubbers (for example Sentry `before_send`, Relay processors, or Drata CCT-linked policies) redact all **16 HIPAA Safe Harbor** identifier categories before telemetry leaves your boundary.

## How zero-PHI-egress canary mechanics work

Traditional PHI tests often require copying realistic patient data into staging or sending payloads to third-party observability vendors. That increases breach surface and complicates BAA scope.

Hermes uses **synthetic canaries** only: fixed, obviously fake Safe Harbor patterns (names, MRNs, SSN-shaped strings, and so on) embedded in a controlled harness. The runner:

1. **Materializes** one vector per Safe Harbor category (16 total).
2. **Applies** the selected scrubber ruleset (`hipaa-safe-harbor-16` by default) the same way an in-process or Sentry-side scrubber should.
3. **Detects leaks** if any raw canary token survives redaction.
4. **Optionally validates Sentry DSN** by scrubbing *before* any network call; only redacted probe metadata is emitted when a DSN is configured.
5. **Writes a cryptographic receipt** (JSON) to your workspace for auditors, GRC tools, or Hermes Relay Pro.

No real patient data is used. Canary strings never leave the runner in cleartext when scrubbing succeeds.

### Safe Harbor categories exercised

```

### PR comment

When triggered on a pull request, Hermes posts a pass/fail summary comment automatically (requires `pull-requests: write` permission). Set `post-comment: 'false'` to disable.

## Hermes Relay Pro and Drata CCT syncing

When you attach a **Hermes Relay Pro** API key, the action signs the receipt with **HMAC-SHA256** and POSTs it to Hermes Relay. Drata (and similar GRC platforms) can ingest those receipts via CCT sync to prove continuous scrubber verification tied to `repository` and `commit_sha`.

```yaml
      - name: Run Hermes PHI canary (Relay Pro)
        id: canary
        uses: g1n0mag1k/hermes-canary-action@v1
        with:
          sentry-dsn: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_DSN }}
          hermes-api-key: ${{ secrets.HERMES_API_KEY }}
          output-dir: ./hermes-evidence

      - name: Surface receipt path
        run: echo "Receipt at ${{ steps.canary.outputs.receipt-path }}"
```

Telemetry endpoint: `POST https://api.hermesrelay.dev/v1/telemetry/receipt`  
Header: `X-Hermes-Signature-256` — HMAC-SHA256 of the canonical JSON body using `hermes-api-key` as the secret.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `sentry-dsn` | No | `''` | Sentry project DSN for optional scrubber reachability checks. Payloads are redacted before egress. |
| `hermes-api-key` | No | `''` | Hermes Relay API key. When set, uploads a signed receipt to Hermes telemetry. |
| `ruleset` | No | `hipaa-safe-harbor-16` | Scrubber ruleset identifier to execute. |
| `fail-on-leak` | No | `true` | When `true`, the action exits with code `1` if any leak is detected. |
| `output-dir` | No | `./hermes-evidence` | Directory for JSON receipts. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `status` | `PASSED` or `FAILED` based on canary harness outcome. |
| `receipt-path` | Absolute path to the generated receipt file on the runner. |

## Receipt schema

Every run writes a JSON receipt to `output-dir` (default `./hermes-evidence`). Free tier receipts have `hmac_sha256: ""`. Pro receipts have a populated HMAC-SHA256 signature over the canonical receipt body.

```json

```

## Verifying a Pro receipt

```python
import hmac, hashlib, json

def verify_receipt(receipt: dict, api_key: str) -> bool:
    body = {**receipt, "hmac_sha256": ""}
    canonical = json.dumps(body, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
    expected = hmac.new(
        api_key.encode("utf-8"),
        msg=canonical.encode("utf-8"),
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, receipt["hmac_sha256"])
```

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
export RULESET=hipaa-safe-harbor-16
export OUTPUT_DIR=./hermes-evidence
python3 entrypoint.py
```
